1. I used Copilot for the last three functions of my script, which would include def clean_column_names(df), def handle_missing_values(df), and def remove_invalid_rows(df). I prompted it by giving it specific numbered commands on how I wanted it to manipulate the data and in what order.
2. The changes I made to Copilot's output were that I had to change the price and qty data from strings to numeric. Copilot did not account for that.
3. What I learned about data cleaning is that this step is crucial if you want to analyze your data. If I had not cleaned the data, it may have breaked my analysis or given me inaccurate results. The strengths of Copilot that I learned was that it can generate code very quickly and save me lots of time. The limitation I learned about Copilot was that it doesn't guess things correctly all the time. It is still important to review the code and make sure it works the way you intended. One specific example from this project was when Copilot assumed the data was numerical when it was actually in strings.
